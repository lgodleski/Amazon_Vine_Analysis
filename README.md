## Summary
From this analysis, there is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program since a significantly larger percentage of non-Vine reviews had 5 stars. However, we could perform another analysis that would show an overall breakdown of rating scores for Vine and non-Vine reviews to see if ratings are generally skewed more positively as shown below:

<br>In this additional analysis, we can see that the non-Vine reviews have more of an even distribution of ratings from 1-4 whereas the Vine reviews have mostly 4 and 5 star ratings which does provide evidence of positivity bias.
