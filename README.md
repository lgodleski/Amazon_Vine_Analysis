## Summary
From this analysis, there is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program since a significantly larger percentage of non-Vine reviews had 5 stars. Another analysis we could perform would be to show an overall breakdown of rating scores for Vine and non-Vine reviews to see if ratings are generally skewed more positively as shown below:
